## Features

## How to use

Since we're not in the chrome store (that's a hassle) you will need to clone this repository wherever.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/remcostoeten/easy-delete-vercelprojects-chrome-extension.git
```
Then navigate to chrome, or whatever fork you use. Type in the extensions `brave://extensions`

where Brave is my browser but I assume it's just chrome for chrome. Anyways, it's the extension page.

Once you're there toggle the switch which says `Developer mode` top right.

Then you're ready to upload it. Click on `Load unpacked` top left. Search for your cloned repo, load that. And that's it, ready to use.
